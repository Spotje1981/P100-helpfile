Connect using ssh to your machine and download your original global_conf.json from packet forwarder docker container to your current dir: sudo docker cp crankk-pktfwd:/home/node/app/global_conf.json .   (there is dot at the end) 2. Modify this file (for example sudo nano global_conf.json ) - find section "gateway_conf" at the end of file and add here parameter/line  "fetch_sleep_ms": 1,  (I added this in the middle after line "push_timeout_ms": 100,)   3. Copy this file to /var/lib/docker/volumes/crankk_data/_data  (you need to be su or use sudo command because of rights).  4. Restart crankk-pktfwd container (you can also use web interface). You can check logs sudo docker logs crankk-pktfwd if everything is ok, or attach to sudo docker attach crankk-pktfwd to see log messages
